         The <head> element should contain elements that provide information about the page.

         Anything that you want to display on the page should go inside the <body> element. 

         Your <head> element therefore should end here, and your <body> start.

      <h2>Welcome to the EZ life</h2>
      <p> Hello & Welcome to the Official fanpage for Easy Life. Here you will find everything and anything Easy Life related.
        From updates to social media links. This page was inspired by my love and appreciation for these cheeky east midlands lads.

      <!-- ***
           <a> elements need to tell the browser two crucial things:
              1: What should be displayed on the page for the user to click
              2: Where should the browser go when it's clicked. 
          
           You've only done the second here. The correct format for <a> elements is:

              <a href="where-to-go.html">What to show on the page to click on</a>

      <!-- ***
           With the controls attribute, you don't need to put ="true". Just including the attribute name
           will set it to true. For example:

           <video controls width="100%">

           You should also include at least one more <source> element with the video in a different 
           format. 
           *** -->
      <video controls="true" width="100%" poster="img/ezlifejunkfood.jpeg">

        <p>Sorry, your browser does not support the video element.
